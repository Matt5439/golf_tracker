⛳️ Golf Score & Performance Tracker
Project Overview
The Golf Score & Performance Tracker is a modern, data-driven web application designed to help golfers systematically collect, track, and analyze their performance data. The primary goal is to transform raw score inputs into actionable, high-value insights that empower users to identify weaknesses, target practice, and ultimately lower their scores.

The platform is designed for seamless, flexible data entry, accommodating anything from a partially completed 5-hole round to a full 18-hole score card.

✨ Key Features

1. Robust Data Tracking
Users can input and track comprehensive metrics for every round played:

Round Scoring: Full score card tracking against selected courses.

Handicap Management: Automatic calculation and tracking of the user's official/unofficial handicap index.

Core Performance Stats: Detailed tracking of:

Putting: Putts per round, putts per green in regulation (GIR).

Driving Accuracy: Fairways hit vs. total fairways.

Short Game: Successful vs. attempted Up-and-Downs (sand saves, scrambles).

2. Granular Club & Strategy Analysis
The application goes beyond simple score tracking by allowing the input of detailed, strategic information:

Club Selection Tracking: Record the specific club used for tee shots on Par 4s and Par 5s.

Example Insight: Analyze Par 4 scoring averages when using a Driver vs. a 3-Wood off the tee.

Course Selection: The ability to select and store data specific to different golf courses.

3. High-Value Insights & Visualization
Data is converted into visually appealing and useful information:

Intuitive Dashboards: A clean, modern, and engaging user interface focused on clarity and aesthetics.

Performance Trends: Visual charts showing improvement or decline over time for key metrics.

Personalized Reports: Generate reports that highlight the user's true strengths and weaknesses (e.g., "Your biggest scoring leak is lag putting from 15-30 feet").

4. Seamless & Flexible Input
The data input system is designed for maximum user convenience:

Flexible Round Lengths: Easily input scores for full 18-hole rounds or incomplete rounds (e.g., 5, 9, or 12 holes), ensuring no data is lost.

Mobile-First Design: Optimized for easy use directly on the course via a mobile device.
